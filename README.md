## What I Do

I am a web developer from Albany NY who enjoys building new things with new people. I started coding when I was 24 years old and became instantly hooked. Now, six years later I am still just as enthused and driven as ever. I primarily use Rails for application development and Ruby for workflow solutions & scripting. Although I love the Ruby language and its smaller frameworks like Sinatra, I have also built solutions for customers in C# and worked with languages like GO and PHP.  I take pride in my problem solving abilities and communication skills with developers and non-developers alike.  I am a hard worker, and would like to apply my knowledge to become an asset for you and your team.
